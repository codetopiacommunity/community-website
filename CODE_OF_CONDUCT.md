# Codetopia Community Code of Conduct

> *A utopia for tech enthusiasts — where everyone belongs.*

---

## Who We Are

Codetopia is an inclusive and collaborative space created to empower aspiring and practicing technologists. We believe technology is more than a tool — it is the foundation of innovation, creativity, and problem-solving.

Our community is guided by six core values: **Inclusivity, Collaboration, Continuous Learning, Practical Application, Innovation, and Integrity**. These values are not just words — they shape how we treat each other, how we build together, and how we grow as a community.

Whether you are writing your first line of code or exploring tech Codetopia is your home.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, age, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.

The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Code of Conduct.

## Encouraged Behaviours

As a Codetopia community member, we encourage you to:

- **Be inclusive** — Welcome people of all skill levels. We were all beginners once. Never gatekeep knowledge or make others feel inferior for what they do not yet know.
- **Be collaborative** — Share knowledge freely. Lift others as you climb. Collective effort drives greater outcomes than individual effort alone.
- **Be respectful** — Engage with empathy and kindness. Respect different viewpoints and experiences.
- **Be constructive** — Give feedback that helps people grow. Critique ideas, not people.
- **Be accountable** — Take responsibility for your actions and contributions. Commit to repairing harm when it occurs.
- **Be a learner** — Stay curious, stay humble, and embrace the fact that in technology there is always more to learn.
- **Give credit** — Always properly credit the sources, ideas, and work of others.

## Restricted Behaviours

The following behaviours are violations of this Code of Conduct. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviours will not be tolerated in any Codetopia space:

### General Violations
- **Harassment** — Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- **Character attacks** — Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group.
- **Discrimination or stereotyping** — Characterizing anyone's personality or behaviour on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
- **Sexualization** — Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context of the community.
- **Violating confidentiality** — Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
- **Endangerment** — Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.

### Tech Community Specific Violations
- **Gatekeeping** — Deliberately making others feel unwelcome or inadequate because of their skill level or background.
- **Elitism** — Dismissing or belittling contributions, questions, or ideas because they are considered too basic or simple.
- **Plagiarism** — Misrepresenting others' code, ideas, or work as your own.
- **Misleading identity** — Impersonating someone else or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
- **Unsolicited promotion** — Sharing marketing or commercial content outside the norms of the community.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a Code of Conduct violation. However, when an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly.

To report a possible violation, please reach out to our Community Moderators privately:

📧 **Email**: [codetopiancommunity@gmail.com](mailto:codetopiancommunity@gmail.com)


Community Moderators take all reports seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports by reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or by interviewing witnesses and other participants. All investigations and enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, prioritising safety and confidentiality at all times.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder will be used to determine how best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved and the community as a whole.

### 1. Warning
**Event**: A violation involving a single incident or series of minor incidents.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from the Community Moderators.
**Repair**: A private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.

### 2. Temporarily Limited Activities
**Event**: A repeated violation that previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period. The cooldown may be limited to particular channels or interactions.
**Repair**: An apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces.

### 3. Temporary Suspension
**Event**: A pattern of repeated violations which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
**Consequence**: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension.
**Repair**: Respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about reintegrating with the community.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Event**: A pattern of repeated violations that other steps have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.
**Consequence**: Access to all Codetopia spaces, tools, and communication channels is permanently removed.
**Repair**: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

This enforcement ladder is a guideline. It does not limit the ability of Community Moderators to use their discretion and judgment in the best interests of the Codetopia community.
